# Project Overview
The Meal Ordering System is a web application designed to facilitate the management of meal orders. It consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend built
using the Express framework. This system allows users to view available meals, place orders, and view order history.


1. **Interactive Meal Catalog Exploration:**
   - Utilizing React components, state management, and custom hooks, users can seamlessly explore a diverse catalog of delicious meals.
   - The dynamic frontend allows for interactive selection and effortless addition of meals to the cart.

2. **Effortless Order Placement with Advanced Checkout:**
   - The application features an intuitive checkout form built with React components and state, ensuring a user-friendly order placement experience.
   - Comprehensive validation mechanisms guarantee that users provide all necessary order details, enhancing the reliability of submitted orders.

3. **Real-time Order Tracking and Comprehensive History:**
   - Users can track the real-time status of their current orders through a dynamic interface powered by React's useEffect hook.
   - The system maintains a detailed history of completed orders, allowing easy referencing and review of past orders using React components and state management.
   - check order.json to see history

4. **Backend Powered by Node.js and Express:**
   - The scalable and non-blocking environment provided by Node.js supports the backend, while Express is employed to create RESTful APIs for handling meal data and order processing.

5. **Data Structure Models and Custom Hooks for Modularity:**
   - The application utilizes models or data structures to represent meal and order information, ensuring organized and efficient data management.
   - Custom hooks are extensively employed to enhance code modularity and encapsulation, contributing to the overall maintainability of the frontend.

6. **File System Module for Data Management:**
   - Node.js fs/promises module is employed for reading and writing data, ensuring seamless data operations between the application and JSON files.

7. **Middleware Integration for Efficient Data Handling:**
   - Middleware such as body-parser is incorporated on the backend to handle JSON data in requests, contributing to efficient data processing and communication between the frontend and backend.
